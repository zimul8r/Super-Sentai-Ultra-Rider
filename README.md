# Super-Sentai-Ultra-Rider
Super Sentai Ultra Rider Game
Character Build
Using Cortex Action with mods. Powers use two choices to pick your powers. You can pick one set of 4 at d6, 3 at d8, and 1 at d10. Or you can have 4 at d6 and 4 at d8.  You can have no more than two power sets. All power sets must have FX and a limit with the mandatory Conscious Activation limit.
  Affiliations are Light, Darkness, and Cosmos. All are d8 but you can raise one to d10 but must step down one.
These are the sources of power you tap into. So if you pick one for an action to do something or against an opponent an effect can happen. If the monster is Darkness based, Light will give you a step up and if you used Darkness step down. If it is not mindless the monster can change its Affiliation and will not know off the bat was it changed it to. So it is a rock, paper, scissors game.  A player can make a roll to see what is the active Affiliation of the monster to find out. 
Attributes are all d8 but can be stepped up by stepping down another stat. You can go as low as d4 and as high as d10.
Attributes are:
Agility
Alertness
Intelligence
Strength
Vitality
Willpower
Distinctions are classic three statements about the character and work the same as Cortex action.
Skill Groups you can pick one of two ways, 3 at d6 and 3 at d8 or 2 at d6, 2 at d8, and 1 at d10. Any skill not chosen is a d4. You can also step down any d6 or greater die into two lower die types and add it to your pool.
